Bitfire Loader Protocol
=============================
& sd2iec Implementation Notes

Documented by Martin Thierer

Bitfire is an IRQ-loader written by Bitbreaker [*], which is mostly
used for demos. You can find a list of known productions using it at
the end of this document.

Loader Revisions
================

Various revisions have been publicly released, but not all seem to
be actually used by any production. Some productions use pre-release
versions of 0.7 with significant differences to both 0.6 and 0.7.

0.1     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=133975
0.2     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=134613
0.3     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=138322
0.4     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=141245
0.5     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=145333 protocol matches 0.4
0.6     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=146211
0.7     no release on CSDb, only tagged in git
1.0     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=201237
1.1     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=214232

git     https://github.com/bboxy/bitfire.git (only >= 0.6)

Note: Parts of this document mention pre-releases of a version "1.2".
      Right now, no such version exists, neither as an official
      release or tagged in git. It's used as a pseudo version for
      multiple loader revisions which contain changes incompatible
      with 1.1 (and each other). They might or might not represent
      what goes into a future, official release, whatever its version
      will be called.

Byte-Transfer Protocols
=======================

All protocols use a clock line, which is always driven by the host.

1-Bit Receive Protocol
----------------------

Used for both drivecode download and commands. Most loader revisions
use DATA as clock line and CLK for the data.

The byte transfer starts on a negative edge of the respective clock
line. Bytes are sent LSB-first and for some loader revisions with the
bit values inverted (data line low is bit == 1 and vice versa).

The drivecode download always uses CLK for data and the data is never
inverted.

            | Clock  |  Data  | inv
------------|--------|--------|-----
  <= 0.5    |  DATA  |  CLK   |
    0.6     |  DATA  |  CLK   |  x
    0.7     |  CLK   |  DATA  |  x
    1.0     |  DATA  |  CLK   |  x
    1.1     |  DATA  |  CLK   |
    1.2     |  CLK   |  DATA  |
------------|--------|--------|-----
dc download |  DATA  |  CLK   |

The host acknowledges each bit with a clock edge. After 8 bits the
clock line is in the same state as in the beginning of the byte
transfer.

2-Bit Send Protocol
-------------------

Used during file transfers for sending both the payload and the
metadata bytes. This protocol is identical for all loader revisions.

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK & DATA are the data lines. The
transfer starts on a negative clock edge and ends on a positive edge.

  c0/d0  |  c1/d1  |  c2/d2  |  c3/d3
---------|---------|---------|---------
  b0/b1  |  b2/b3  |  b4/b5  |  b6/b7

Installation
============

All revisions transfer an installer stub using M-W commands. It is
started using a M-E command without any additional payload and
downloads the rest of the drivecode from the host.

Drivecode Download
------------------

The drive sets either CLK (<= 0.4) or DATA (> 0.4) when it's ready to
receive. The host then starts the transfer with a short ATN low pulse.

The bytes are transferred using the 1-bit receive protocol (see "Byte-
Transfer Protocols", above). Note this always uses DATA as clock line
and sends the data bit non-inverted, even for loader revisions which
use a slightly different protocol to transmit commands.

Revisions < 0.6 set ATN between bytes and the first bit is valid with
the positive ATN edge. Later versions just use the clock line (DATA).

Revisions > 0.6 set ATN at the end of the drivecode transfer.

ATN Responder
-------------

If the loader detects additional drives on the bus, revisions < 1.0
show a warning and refuse to start until this is corrected.

Later revisions install an "ATN responder" on the other drives, which
monitors the ATN IN signal and sets ATNA accordingly, to minimize the
effect on the DATA line.

If used as a passive device on the bus, the sd2iec firmware also
detects this and enters "sleep mode", which is indicated by the static
error LED and which can be deactivated by a long press of the disk
change button.

Directory Layout
================

All revisions can handle random file requests, for which a custom
directory is used (so bitfire "files" are not referenced from the CBM
DOS directory).

The first directory sector is always $12/$12, extending to sectors $11
and $10, if necessary.

The directory sector layout differs between 0.x and 1.x revisions.
Each file entry is 6 bytes for the 0.x versions and 4 bytes for the
1.x versions, as these don't store the individual start sectors for
each file (see "Sector Chains", below). All versions can handle a
maximum of 126 files, which would use 3 sectors in 0.x and 2 sectors
in 1.x revisions (42*3 == 63*2 == 126).

          |   $00 .. $fb file entries  | $fc $fd $fe $ff |
  --------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  0.x     | [ TR ST AL AH LL LH ] * 42 |              ID |
  1.0/1.1 | [       AL AH LL LH ] * 63 |  FT  FS  FO  ID |

          | $00 $01 $02 $03 |   $04 .. $ff file entries  |
  --------|-----------------|----------------------------|
  1.2pre1 |  FT  FS  FO  ID | [       AL AH LL LH ] * 63 |

          | $00 $01 $02 $03 |   $04 .. $ff file entries  |
  --------|-----------------|----------------------------|
  1.2pre2 |  FT  FS  FO  ID |   AL*63 AH*63 LL*63 LH*63  |

  TR/ST    file start sector (0.x only)
  AL/AH    file load address low/high (-$100 for 1.2)
  LL/LH    file length-1 (!) low/high
  FT/FS/FO first (!) entry's track, sector- and byte-offset (1.x only)
  ID       disk id

Note: In revision 1.2 the load address stored in the directory entry
      is the actual load address - $100.

Sector Chains
=============

The individual sectors of each file are not linked using the first
two bytes of each sector (like in CBM DOS) but instead all 256 bytes
are used for payload data and the next sector is found using the
following algorithm:

  next_sector = current_sector + sector_interleave

  if next_sector >= number_of_sectors_on_current_track:
    next_sector = (next_sector % sector_interleave) + 1

    if next_sector == sector_interleave: // done with track
      next_sector = 0
      track = track + 1 // +2 if track == $11 (skip directory track)

Most known productions use an interleave of 4 sectors for all tracks,
except those with the latest pre-release loader revision, which uses
4 for tracks < 18 and interleave 3 for all other tracks.

The files on the disk are stored contiguous, so a block might contain
data of (at least) two files.

1.x revisions don't store the start sector for every file, but only
for the first entry of each directory sector (see "Directory Layout",
above). For random access, the start sector and the start offset in
this sector (see "File Transfer", below) have to be calculated by
iterating over the preceding entries in that directory sector and
adding up the file sizes. (This isn't necessary for sequential access,
because the start position is still known as the byte following the
previous file's last byte).

Request Handling
================

After initialization, the drive enters the job loop and waits for
one-byte commands from the host.

Which bus line is set by the host to start the request differs between
loader versions: 0.1 sets ATN, the other versions the same line which
is used as clock line for the 1-bit receive protocol (DATA for 0.2 to
0.6, 1.0 and 1.1, CLK otherwise).

The command byte is transferred using the 1-bit receive protocol (see
"Byte-Transfer Protocols", above).

The command normally indicates the (zero-based) index of the requested
file. As all versions support a maximum of 126 files, valid values are
$00 to $7d, plus some special commands:

  $80  custom drivecode upload (not supported on sd2iec)
  $ef  next file (index of previous file + 1 or 0 if first request)
  $fx  disk id; wait for disk with this id to be inserted
  $ff  drive reset (quits job loop)

After the command was received, the drive sets DATA to indicate that
it's busy.

File Transfer
-------------

Every block is preceded by a few bytes of metadata ("preamble"), which
differs between the various loader revisions.

For older revisions, the file's load address is only sent for the
first block, but 1.0 and later instead send each block's start
address. This is necessary, because these revisions always only
transfer the relevant portion of the file's first block (remember,
file data is stored contiguous), so the low byte of the subsequent
blocks' load address differs from the file's load address.

              | file's first block  | subsequent blocks |
  ------------|---------------------|-------------------|
      0.1     |     AH AL    BI LN  |        BI    LN   |
    0.2/0.3   |  00 AH AL    BH LN  |  00    BH    LN   |
    0.4/0.5   |  BD AH AL    BH LN  |  BD    BH    LN   |
   0.6/0.7pre |  BD AL AH    BH LN  |  BD    BH    LN   |
      0.7     |  BD AL AH BR BH LN  |  00 BR BH    LN   |
      1.x     |  00 BR AH AL    LN  |  80 BR BH BL LN   |

  AL/AH   file's load address low/high.
  BL/BH   current block's load address low/high.
  BI      zero-based block index in file.
  BR      "barrier"; high byte of the highest contiguous block's
          end address (+1 for 0.7)
  BD      delta of number of contiguous blocks so far ($ff for first)
          shifted left by 2 bits so that CLK and DATA are always set
          in the first bitpair.
  LN      length of current block in bytes.

The barrier byte is needed for the decruncher when sending blocks out
of order, like the loader does. As the sd2iec implementation sends all
blocks in order, it is always set to the current block's load address
high byte (which also seems to work just fine for 0.7).

As a special case, some productions using pre-release versions of 0.7
were built with the BITFIRE_DEBUG flag set. These additionally send
the current file's index as the second byte of the first block's
header (between BD and AL).

Bus Lock
--------

If the host sets ATN in a loader revision that supports it (>= 0.7
pre-releases), the drive ignores all activity on the other bus lines
until ATN is released again. This makes it possible for the host to
modify $dd00 without confusing the drive.

Disk Change
-----------

If the host requests a disk change (command value $f0 to $fe), the
drive keeps reading the first directory sector ($12/$12) and checks
the byte at either sector offset $ff (<= 1.1) or $03 (1.2) for the
requested disk id.

For loader versions <= 0.3 there is an extra handshake, where the
drive sets CLK after the correct disk has been identified and the host
acknowledges with either one (<= 0.2) or two (0.3) short ATN low
pulses.

BoozeLoader Protocol
=============================
& sd2iec Implementation Notes

Documented by Martin Thierer

BoozeLoader is an IRQ-loader written by HCL [*], which is mostly used
for demos. You can find a list of known productions using it at the
end of this document.

Loader Revisions
================

The only public release seems to be revision "1.0"
(https://csdb.dk/release/?id=145208).

The productions crediting HCL use variations of the code. The transfer
protocols are identical for all versions, they mostly differ in how
files are addressed and how disk-change and -identification are
handled.

Byte-Transfer Protocols
=======================

All protocols use a clock line, which is always driven by the host.

1-Bit Receive Protocol
----------------------

Used by the host for requesting files and sending commands.

The transfer starts with ATN set by the host. The drive releases DATA
by setting ATNA, when it's ready.

ATN is the clock line and CLK is the data line.

Bytes are sent LSB-first with the bit values inverted (data line low
is bit == 1 and vice versa).

Each bit is valid at the falling ATN edges and the drive acknowledges
each bit by setting ATNA. If this isn't the end of the file chain, the
host will set ATN again for the next block, otherwise it stays in the
idle state (all lines released) until the next request.

2-Bit Send Protocol
-------------------

Used for sending data (file content or disk ids) to the host.

Data is sent in response to a command or file request so ATN is still
set after the last bit received via the 1-bit receive protocol.

When the data is ready, the drive releases DATA by setting ATNA. The
host then releases ATN which starts the transfer.

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK & DATA are the data lines.

Installation
============

Most loader revisions send some bootstrap code with a M-E command,
which then reads the actual loader code from (depending on the actual
version) 2-4 blocks on the directory track [$12 $0f $0c $09] to $300
in the drive's memory.

Others install the code from the host, using a couple of M-W commands
instead.

Request Handling
================

After the drivecode has been installed, the drive enters the request
loop.

There are three types of requests:
  - File request
  - Disk identification / change request
  - Bus lock

The idle bus state is all lines released. To make a request, the host
sets ATN. The drive then reads the request byte(s) using the 1-bit
receive protocol (see above).

File Transfer
--------------

There are two methods of addressing files. Neither uses the standard
CBM DOS directory:

1. Directory Sector

  This method is used by most of the known productions and only sends
  one byte, which is used as an index into a sector on track $12 which
  contains up to $7f start-track/-sector pairs.

  Which sector is used for the directory differs between loader
  revisions: Most use sector $09, some $0c and Edge of Disgrace [037]
  uses $06.

2. Start-Track and -Sector

  In this case the host sends two bytes, the track and the sector of
  the start of the sector chain.

Regardless how the start sector is found, the sectors are then linked
using the standard CBM DOS method, where the first two bytes either
indicate track and sector of the next block, or the end of the sector
chain (if the first byte is $00) and the number of bytes used in this
last sector (second byte).

Each block (including the 2 link bytes) is sent using the 2-bit send
protocol as outlined under "Byte-Transfer Protocols", above. After
each transfer the host acknowledges the last bit by releasing ATN. For
the last block of each file, only the actually used bytes as indicated
by the block length at offset $01 of the sector (but still including
the link bytes) are sent.

Disk Change
-----------

The last byte of the BAM sector $12/$00 for disks of multi-disk
productions contains a disk identifier byte.

How this byte is accessed differs between loader versions:

1. For versions using file index addressing and a dir sector, the
host sends a request byte with bit 7 set, where the lower 7 bits are
the expected id of the next disk. The drive then keeps checking the
id byte of the current disk until the requested id is found. It then
sets ATNA (releases DATA) and waits for the next request.

2. Versions using track/sector addressing send a zero for the first
byte (which would be the track number) as a request to identify the
current disk. In this case no second byte (which would otherwise be
the sector number) is sent by the host. The drive then reads sector
$12/$00 and sends the disk id using the standard protocol normally
used for sector transfers.

The host keeps sending this identification request until the response
matches the expected result. It then continues doing normal requests.

Bus Lock
--------

In some loader revisions, the value 0xff locks the bus until a L/H/L/H
sequence is detected on ATN, where each phase is 18us. The drive
ignores all other changes on the bus lines which makes it possible for
the host to modify $dd00 without having to mask the IEC line bits.

Known Productions using this Loader (as of February 2025)
=========================================================

Note: The table below is compiled from releases on CSDb crediting
      HCL for loader or code, plus a few others found during testing.
      It might not be complete and productions not listed have not
      been tested and therefore might not work with the sd2iec
      implementation.

Reference:
  DS = directory sector (on track $12; t/s addressing, if none)

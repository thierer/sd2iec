Krill's Loader Protocols
=============================
& sd2iec Implementation Notes

Documented by Martin Thierer

Note this is the IRQ-loader, *not* Transwarp (also by Krill [*], but
an entirely different loader). It is mostly used by demos and some
games. You can find a list of known productions using it at the end of
this document.

Loader Revisions
================

Various revisions have been publicly released, but some productions
use in-between revisions, which protocol-wise in most cases match a
released version.

 58pre    protocol version that predates r58, no public release
 58       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=78348
146       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=118713 protocol matches r58
159       no public release
164       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=167152
166       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=169364 protocol matches r164
184       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=189130
186       no public release
190       no public release
192       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=220685 protocol matches r190
194       https://csdb.dk/release/?id=226124 protocol matches r190

Byte-Transfer Protocols
=======================

The actual bus lines used vary between revisions, but otherwise the
protocols are similar.

Most protocols use a clock line, which is always driven by the host.
The only exception is the "resend" protocol (only available as an
option in r146), which uses cycle-exact timing instead.

1-Bit Receive Protocol
----------------------

Used for drivecode download, the filename of file requests and the
save plugin of revisions >= 186.

r164/r166 uses this protocol with different lines when receiving the
drivecode and for request filenames.

                    | Clock  |  Data
--------------------|--------|--------
<= 146              |   CLK  |  DATA
159                 |  DATA  |   CLK
164/166 (drivecode) |  DATA  |   CLK
164/166 (filenames) |   CLK  |   ATN
>= 184              |  DATA  |   CLK

The byte transfer starts on a negative edge of the respective clock
line, with the exception of r164/r166, which starts on the positive
edge.

Bytes are sent LSB-first with the bit values inverted (data line
low is bit == 1 and vice versa).

The host acknowledges each bit with a clock edge. After 8 bits the
clock line is in the same state as in the beginning of the byte
transfer.

1-Bit Send Protocol
-------------------

Only used by the save plugin (added in r186, first used in Scramble
Infinity 1.2 [051]), to send a drive memory backup and metadata to
the host.

CLK is the clock line (driven by the host) and DATA is the data line.

Bytes are sent MSB-first with the bit values inverted (data line
low is bit == 1 and vice versa).

The byte transfer starts with CLK high and the DATA line set to !b7.

2-Bit Send "ATN" Protocol
-------------------------

Used during file transfers for sending both the payload and the
metadata bytes. This protocol is identical for all revisions but
58pre, which uses a different bit-order and -polarity.

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK & DATA are the data lines.

      |  c0/d0  |  c1/d1  |  c2/d2  |  c3/d3
------|---------|---------|---------|---------
58pre | !b7/!b5 | !b6/!b4 | !b3/!b1 | !b2/!b0
>= 58 |  b0/b1  |  b2/b3  |  b4/b5  |  b6/b7

2-Bit Send "Resend" Protocol
----------------------------

Alternative 2-bit send protocol, only available in r146.

This is the only protocol which doesn't utilize a clock line to fully
synchronize the byte transfer, but instead sends the bits with a
fixed timing and just keeps trying if the host was interrupted
during the transfer.

The host triggers the start of the byte by releasing ATN and keeps
it released during the transfer. If ATN is not set in time after the
last bit was sent, it's assumed the host was interrupted and the same
byte is sent again. This is signaled to the host by setting CLK.

 [us] |  ATN |  CLK | DATA |
----------------------------
    0 | 0->1 |   1  |      | timing reference
   14 |   1  |  b0  |  b1  |
   22 |   1  |  b2  |  b3  |
   30 |   1  |  b4  |  b4  |
   38 |   1  |  b6  |  b7  |
42/46 |   1  |   1  |      | 42us if TWO_BITS_RESEND_OPTIMIZE is set

   50 |  (1) | 1->0 |      | if ATN was not set by host -> send again

Fast Serial Send Protocol
-------------------------

A C128 host (supported on >= r184) will use the fast serial protocol
via the CIA hardware shift register for payload transfer, if support
is detected during the install phase. Otherwise it falls back to the
standard 2-bit ATN protocol.

ATN edges are used for read acknowledge, starting with a negative
edge after the first byte of each block.

If the loader was built with the ASYNCHRONOUS_BURST_HANDSHAKE flag,
the host won't use the CIA's ICR SR flag for write acknowledge, but
the drive instead sends them using CLK edges, starting with a positive
egde after a block's first byte.

Build-Time Options
==================

Some of the loader's many configuration options are relevant for the
transfer protocol.

Revisions r190 and later send the values of these options together
with the M-E command which starts the request loop (see "ID-Strings",
below).

For legacy productions the values are extracted from the drivecode
download, if the specific variant is known. For unknown variants
default values are used, which might not be correct and therefore not
work.

Maximum Filename Length
-----------------------

For protocol version r58pre the maximum length is always 2, for later
revisions it is a configuration option.

If the configured value is less than the CBM DOS standard of 16 bytes,
the filename used for the request only has to match as a prefix for a
directory entry.

The option value is included in the ID-String present starting with
r190 (see below). For earlier revisions, the value is extracted from
the drivecode download if the variant is known, otherwise it defaults
to 16.

Non-standard Directory
----------------------

The loader can be configured to use a non-standard location for the
directory ("shadow directory"). Early releases (until r146) allowed
both the track and sector to be configured. In this case the sector
denotes the equivalent of the BAM sector, so the first directory
sector is the one referenced from this sector. In later releases
it's only possible to change the directory track, in this case the
directory always starts at sector 1 of that track.

The directory track is only relevant if a D64 image is mounted. It
is included in the ID-String present in r190 and later. For earlier
revisions, the value is extracted from the drivecode download if the
variant is known, otherwise it defaults to the mounted image type's
standard.

Productions using a non-standard directory start sector are marked
with a "D" in the rightmost column of the "Known Productions" table
below.

2-Bit Protocol Variant
----------------------

The few known productions using the "resend" protocol are detected
by their respective, distinct installer stub CRC values. They are
marked with a "R" in the rightmost column of the "Known Productions"
table below.

Other, unknown productions using this protocol might not work.

File Addressing Mode
--------------------

A few productions use the start sector instead of the filename for
addressing files.

The sd2iec implementation tries to detect these by checking if the
first two bytes are a valid track and sector, if the first requested
file wasn't found by name. This isn't 100% reliable, but works for
all known productions using this loader. Not supported for D71 and
D81 images.

Productions using start sector addressing are marked with a "T" in
the rightmost column in the "Known Productions" table below.

Loader revisions r164 and later only support filename addressing.

Installation
============

The initial installation of the loader code in the drive has the
following phases:

1) Various checks are performed to identify the drive and make sure
   it is able to execute custom code. In the early revisions (up to
   r146) this code is transferred using M-W commands, later revisions
   send it as extra payload in the M-E command.

   The sd2iec implementation simulates the drive type according to
   the mounted image's type:
   - none or D64/D41 -> 1541
   - D71 -> 1571
   - D81 -> 1581

2) A loader stub is transferred to the drive using a couple of M-W
   commands.

3) The loader stub is started with a M-E command and takes over the
   transfer of the rest of the drive code. On a 1541 the drive code
   uses most of the available drive memory, including the zero page.

4) After the drivecode has been installed, the drive releases its
   "busy" line, then the host releases a different line to start a
   request. The actual bus lines used for both purposes differ
   between revisions.

ID-Strings
----------

Starting with r190, an ID-String is added to some of the M-E commands
sent during installation, to simplify identification of the loader
without relying on crcs (which otherwise might require a sd2iec
firmware update for new loader revisions):

- Drive Identification

  4d 2d 45 0a 02 4b 52 49 4c 4c <drive identification code>
  M  -  E  $020a K  R  I  L  L

- Request Loop Start

  This M-E command also includes the values of some configuration
  options.

  Example:

  4d 2d 45 09 02 4b 52 49 4c 4c xx xx c0 00 40 29 12 10 00
  M  -  E  $0209 K  R  I  L  L  AD AD RV RV PF DR DT FL CF

  AD Drivecode start-address low/high (variable)

  RV Loader revision low/high (here: $00c0 == 192)
  PF Platform (here: $40 == 64 == C64)
  DR Drive model (here: $29 == 41 == 1541)
  DT Directory track (here: $12 == 18)
  FL Maximum filename length (here: $10 == 16)
  CF Internal configuration flags

  Currently only the directory track and the maximum filename length
  are actually used by the sd2iec implementation.

- ATN Responder

  If the loader detects a secondary device on the bus, it tries to
  silence it by installing an ATN responder. The M-E command which
  then starts the ATN responder also has an ID-String.

  4d 2d 45 0b 02 4b 52 49 4c 4c <ATN responder start code>
  M  -  E  $020b K  R  I  L  L

Drivecode Download
------------------

1) Drive sets CLK when it's ready to receive
2) Host sets either ATN (r184 and later) or DATA (earlier revisions)
3) Drive releases CLK
4) Drive receives drivecode using the 1-bit receive protocol (see
   "Byte-Transfer Protocols", above).
5) Only <= r146: Host waits for drive to set CLK.

The length of the drivecode is implicitly embedded in both the first
byte of the drivecode (only high byte) and the loop instructions of
the loader stub sent in M-W commands before the drivecode (only low
byte) and is therefore cumbersome and unreliable to extract.

So the sd2iec implementation uses a 90ms timeout waiting for a change
on the clock line instead.

This works for revisions r146 and earlier, as the host waits for
the drive to set CLK before continuing (step 5 above).

Later revisions don't have this handshake, so the host might start
its first request immediately after the transfer is complete. To
prevent that, the sd2iec firmware sets the "busy" line as soon as
the last build-time option value has been extracted from the
drivecode download.

ATN Responder
-------------

Starting with release r164, the loader checks for other devices
present on the bus during installation. If found (and if they pass the
drive detection) an "ATN responder" is installed, which monitors the
ATN IN signal and sets ATNA accordingly, to minimize the effect on the
DATA line.

If used as a passive device on the bus, the sd2iec firmware also
detects this and enters "sleep mode", which is indicated by the static
error LED and which can be deactivated by a long press of the disk
change button.

Request Handling
================

After the drivecode has been transferred, the drive enters the request
loop.

There are four types of requests:
  - File request
  - "File exists" check
  - Uninstall command (drive resets)
  - Custom drivecode upload

In the sd2iec firmware, custom drivecode is generally not supported,
only the save plugin introduced in r186 is emulated (see below).

To signal a request, the host releases the respective "request" line.
The drive responds by releasing the "busy" line.

               | request |   busy
---------------|---------|---------
<= 146         |   ATN   |   CLK
159            |   DATA  |   CLK
164/166        |   ATN   |   DATA
>= 184         |   DATA  |   CLK

If the host sets the "busy" line when releasing the "request" line,
this signals either an uninstall request (the drive does a reset) or
a custom drivecode upload (see below).

Otherwise it's a file request.

File Transfer
-------------

For a file request, the host usually sends a filename, with the
following exceptions/peculiarities:

- Filename bytes are transferred until either a zero byte is sent or
  the maximum filename length (see "Build-Time Options", above) is
  reached. Revisions r190 and later always send a trailing zero byte.

- An empty filename (only a zero byte is sent) denotes a "next file"
  request.

- File types are ignored, even directory entries with file type zero
  are considered, as long as the entry has a non-zero track number
  for the first file sector.

- If Track/Sector addressing is used (only <= r146), the protocol
  is the same as for the filename, except the transfer always stops
  after the second byte.

After the filename was transferred, the drive sets the busy line
again, until the first block is available.

If there was an error when opening the file ("file not found"), only
one byte of metadata ($ff) is sent as an error code (see below).

The transfer always starts with the first sector of the file, after
that the sectors might be transferred out of order, as they are read
from the disk.

All revisions generally transfer 254 bytes for full blocks and
possibly fewer for the file's last sector.

The sector link bytes are not transferred and instead replaced with
up to two bytes of metadata. The significance and encoding of these
two bytes differs between protocol revisions, but generally this
information is included, sometimes implicitly:

- Index of current block (or delta to previous block as 2s-complement)
- Flag for the file's last block and in this case also the number of
  payload bytes (which might be fewer than the standard of 254)
- Number of contiguous blocks transferred (total number of transferred
  blocks might be higher for out-of-order transfers)
- EOF indicator

If the first byte of metadata indicates either "file not found" ($ff)
or "end of file" ($fe or $00, depending on the protocol version) no
more bytes are sent for the request (not even a second metadata byte).

<= r146:
  Byte 0: $ff: "file not found"
          $fe: "end of file"
          otherwise: 0-based blockindex
  Byte 1: number of bytes in block

r159, r164/r166:
  Byte 0: $ff: "file not found"
          $00: "end of file"
          otherwise:
            Bits 7-1: 0x40 ^ blockindex delta in respect to previous
                             block (0 for last block)
            Bit    0: flag for "last block"
  Byte 1: last block: 1 - number of bytes in block
          otherwise:  1 + number of contiguous blocks

r184:
  Byte 0: $ff: "file not found"
          $00: "end of file"
          otherwise:
            Bits 7-1: blockindex delta in respect to previous block
            Bit    0: flag for "last block"
  Byte 1: last block: 0 - number of bytes in block
          otherwise:  1 + number of contiguous blocks

>= r186:
  Byte 0: $ff: "file not found"
          $00: "end of file"
          otherwise:
            last block: 0 - number of bytes in block
            otherwise:  number of contiguous blocks
  Byte 1: Bits 7-1: blockindex delta in respect to previous block
          Bit    0: flag for "last block"

The 2-bit protocol or - if supported by the hardware - the fast serial
protocol is used for the entire transfer. After each block the drive
sets the busy line. If either "file not found" or "end of file" was
sent, the transfer is complete. Otherwise the next block is fetched
and sent.

Note that the final block of the transfer isn't necessarily the last
(logical) block of the file, as blocks might be sent out of order.

"File exists" Check
-------------------

Revision r190 adds a "file exists" check: If the host set CLK before
releasing ATN when the drive is about to send the first metadata byte,
the transfer is aborted and the drive instead only indicates if the
requested file exists (DATA released) or not (DATA set).

Custom Code Upload
------------------

Universal support of custom code would require specific detection and
emulation of the respective custom code (or a full drive emulation).

Therefore only the official save plugin introduced with r186 is
supported.

In r186, the host signals a custom code upload request by setting
CLK when releasing the request line. In r190 and later the code upload
is just sent like the filename. If the "filename" is longer than
16+2 bytes, then it is a code upload.

Before installing the actual custom code, the plugin framework first
sends a backup of most of the drive memory to the host. This isn't
really relevant for the sd2iec implementation, but still has to
be simulated. The protocol of r186 (used for the save plugin of
Scramble Infinity 1.2 [051]) relies on the drive sending the exact
number of bytes expected for the backup, which therefore has to be
extracted from the code download. The protocol was redesigned for
r192 to work with a timeout, similar to how the initial drivecode
download is handled.

Save-Plugin
-----------

The save plugin is restricted in that it can only overwrite (not
create or extend) an existing file. This isn't fully implemented in
the sd2iec emulation, which deletes and re-creates the file, but
still refuses to write to a non-existing file.

Communication with the host is using the 1-bit send and receive
protocols. The filename is sent as part of the save plugin code.

The save plugin then sends a metadata byte, which is either an error
code ($fe "write protect on" or $ff "file not found"), or the length
of the file in blocks.

After that, the host sends the new data for the file in blocks of
a maximum of 254 bytes. Every block is preceded by one byte for
the number of bytes in the block (only relevant for the last block,
otherwise always $fe).

After the file has been sent, the drive restores the memory backup
it sent before downloading the custom code and then re-enters the
request loop.

Known Productions using this Loader (as of February 2025)
=========================================================

Note: The table below is compiled from releases on CSDb crediting
      Krill for the loader, plus a few others found during testing.
      It might not be complete and productions not listed have not
      been tested and therefore might not work. Some (mostly pre-2007)
      productions use a different codebase/protocol and therefore are
      neither supported by the sd2iec implementation nor listed here.

The protocol version listed in the table doesn't necessarily match
the actual loader revision used, but the public loader release that
uses this protocol. Exceptions are revisions "58pre", "159" and "186",
which all don't have public stand-alone loader releases. For loaders
sending an id string it's the repository version from the id string.

Production-specific Remarks
---------------------------

[067] Colour Spectrum
  This is a C128 release.

[077] Protogeo 100%
  The interactive part at the end of the demo uses unsupported custom
  drivecode and therefore doesn't work.

[096] Out of Contex
  The side b diskimage contains a duplicate, illegal directory entry
  for the file "WKQ", which only affects the sd2iec implementation
  because of a slight difference in how directory lookup works.

  The image can be easily fixed, e.g. with sed, like so:
  $ sed -bie 's/\x15\(\x05\x57\)/\x00\1/' ALD_Out_of_Contex_SIDEB.d64

[128] Bzzz!
  To make it work, rename the loader PRG "BZZZ" to something where the
  first two characters don't clash with any of the other files, e.g.
  "LOADER".

[205] Protogeo 80%
  Hangs at some point for unknown reasons. 100% version [077] works
  for the most part (see remarks above).

[222] SIDrip Alliance Music Collection 2010
  Uses additional, unsupported custom drivecode and therefore doesn't
  work.

[228] Recollection #3
  To make it work, rename the loader PRG (the first directory entry)
  to something that doesn't start with "< ", like "- RECOLLECTION -".

[253] The Wild Bunch
  Hangs at some point because it uses unsupported custom drivecode.

[259] Recollection #1
  Krill's loader is only used for the intro. The diskmag itself uses
  some different, unsupported loader and therefore doesn't work.

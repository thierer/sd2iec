The following revisions have been released on CSDb:

1.0     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=118725
2.0     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=139503
2.1     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=139611

Revisions 1.0 and 2.0 don't seem to be used by any production, so they
have neither been tested nor are documented here. You can find a list
of the productions which have been tested, which also includes the
loader revision they use, at the end of this document.

Byte-Transfer Protocols
=======================

1-bit Receive Protocol
----------------------

Used by the 3.x revisions to receive the index into the async sector
job table in case of an asynchronous command (see "Async Requests",
below). (As the 2.x revisions don't have random access for jobs,
there is no need to receive data from the host).

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK is the data line.

The 7-bit (!) value is sent MSB-first with the bit values inverted
(data line low is bit == 1 and vice versa).

The byte transfer starts with clock (ATN) set by the host. The drive
releases DATA when it's ready to receive.

Data is valid after the positive clock edge. The drive acknowledges
that it read the bit by setting DATA and releases it after the host
set ATN again.

2-bit Send Protocol
-------------------

The protocol used to send all data to the host. It is identical for
all revisions, but 2.x revisions use a different byte encoding than
3.x. Unit lengths (see the 3.x sections of "Stream Format" and
"Communication Protocol", below) are not encoded, but the block
checksums of 2.x are.

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK & DATA are the data lines. The
transfer starts with a positive clock edge.

                  |  c0/d0  |  c1/d1  |  c2/d2  |  c3/d3
------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------
2.x               | !b3/!b1 | !b2/!b0 | !b6/!b4 | !b7/!b5
3.x unit length   |  b0/b1  |  b2/b3  |  b4/b5  |  b6/b7
3.x payload bytes | !b3/!b1 | !b2/!b0 | !b4/!b5 | !b6/b7

Installation
============

All loader revisions install the drivecode by sending a small M-E
command with some extra code which then loads the drivecode from
sectors $11, $0c, $0b and $02 on track 18. No code is transferred
from the host using M-W commands.

ATN Responder
-------------

If the loader detects additional drives on the bus, the 3.x revisions
install an "ATN responder" on the other drives, which monitors the
ATN IN signal and sets ATNA accordingly, to minimize the effect on the
DATA line. (Earlier revisions just won't work if other devices are
present).

If used as a passive device on the bus, the sd2iec firmware also
detects this and enters "sleep mode", which is indicated by the static
error LED and which can be deactivated by a long press of the disk
change button.

Stream Format
=============

The Loader doesn't use the CBM DOS directory or the standard sector
format with the 2 first bytes linking to the next sector at all, but
instead just loads and transfers a pre-defined chain of file-like
bundles of sectors which is encoded in and controlled by "commands"
consisting of 3 bytes each (MSBs left):

   [0]        [1]       [2]
XXX0 1234  5678 9ABC  DEFG HIJK

"X" are flags; their significance differs between revisions and is
documented below. "0" though "K" indicate if the corresponding sector
of the current track should be read ("0" => sector 0, "K" => sector
20).

For the 2.x revisions, processing of the chain is fixed, the host can
only control the speed at which it accepts data. 3.x enables the host
to randomly access some (pre-selected) bundles (called "jobs").

Init Sector
-----------

The initial command for each disk is read from sector $12/$11.

Command processing always starts on track 1 and continues through the
tracks in strictly increasing order. The next commands are extracted
from the bytestream as it is read from disk. How the commands are
encoded into the bytestream differs between revisions.

In addition to the initial command, the init sector also contains a
3 byte id for the current disk and for the 2.x revisions also the
expected id for the next disk, if applicable (see below).

2.x revisions
-------------

For most sectors, all 256 bytes of a sector are used for payload. The
drive calculates a checksum (xor sum of all values in the sector). If
the checksum has bit 7 set, this indicates that the checksum is also
the first byte of the next command. In this case the other two
command-bytes are 1. the byte at offset $00 of the sector and 2. the
xor'ed values of the bytes at offsets $00 and $01:

  next_cmd[$00] = checksum
  next_cmd[$01] = sector[$00]
  next_cmd[$02] = sector[$00] ^ sector[$01]

The sectors requested by a command are read from the current track in
random order, so the next command is also encountered at a random time
when processing a command. As it doesn't come into effect before all
sectors of the current command have been read and transferred, it has
to be stored.

As bit 7 of the first command byte is always 1 (because that's what
identifies the checksum as a command), only bits 6 and 5 are used as
flags:

  - Bit 7              - always set
  - Bit 6 "eof1"       - command starts a new bundle
  - Bit 5 "next track" - advance to next track (but skipping track 18)

Because one command only addresses sectors on a single track, a file
spanning multiple tracks will have one or more commands embedded that
indicate which sectors to read from the next track. These commands
will have bit 5 ("next track") set and the last command of each file
will have bit 6 ("eof1") set.

If none of the sector flags are set in a command, this indicates a
"special command", which can be either a drive reset (if flag bit 5 is
set) or a "disk flip" (if flag bit 5 is not set).

When a disk flip command is encountered, the drive keeps checking the
3-byte "side id" at offset $f7 of the current disk's init sector
$12/$11 until it matches the expected "next side id" (which was stored
at offset $fa of the previous disk's init sector).

In the 2.3 loader revision, the "next side id" is stored in reverse
order in respect to the "side id".

3.x revisions
-------------

In the 3.x revisions, each sector has a maximum payload of only 255
bytes (instead of the 256 in 2.x). The byte at offset $00 of each
sector is always a combination of 2 flag bits (bits 7 and 6) and the
sector number (bits 4 to 0). (The sector number is not relevant for
the protocol, the loader just uses it as a convenient way to know
which sector it just read, so it can be removed from its internal list
of sectors to read from the current track for the active command).

- Bit 7 "full" sector
  If set, all the bytes $01..$ff are payload. If not set, the sector
  consists of a number of smaller "units" which are sent separately.
- Bit 6 "continuation record"
  If set, the sector contains a "continuation record" (see below).
  A sector with a continuation record can never be a "full" sector.

A "continuation record" (CR) always includes a command similar to the
ones known from the 2.x revisions, but can additionally contain a
number of "postponed units". These are chunks of data with a length
between 2 and 4 bytes each, which (like the next command) don't come
into effect until all sectors of the current command have been
processed. The loader uses a 96-byte buffer to store both the next
command and the postponed units. As the command is 3 bytes, this
leaves 93 bytes for postponed units (including the length bytes and a
trailing zero byte).

In all cases ("full" sector or not, with or without CR) all unit's
data in the sector is stored in reverse order. (For a better
understanding of the sector layout, see the example, below).

The units in a "not full" sector (either with or without a CR) are
"preceded" by a byte indicating the length of the unit. A length of
zero marks the end of the unit chain.

In a "not full" sector without a CR, the unit chain starts at offset
$ff with the length byte of the first unit. (For "full" sectors the
length is implicitly 255 bytes, so a length byte is not needed and not
present).

If the sector contains a CR (bit 6 of byte at offset $00 is set), it's
a bit more complicated: The command is stored at offsets $fd to $ff,
so the unit chain starts at offset $fc. All units at the start of the
chain with a length of 4 or shorter are "postponed units". As
mentioned above, the postponed units have to be stored until the
current command has been fully processed, but regular units are sent
immediately.

Commands have the same format as the 2.x revisions, but the flag bits
have a different meaning:

- Bit 7 "new job"   - command starts a new job
- Bit 6 "new track" - advance to next track (but skipping track 18)
- Bit 5 "ondemand"  - loads and executes code from sector on track 18

Commands with the "ondemand" flag set are used for disk flip and reset
handling, similar to what the "special command" does in 2.x. They are
like a regular command, but with only one sector flag set. This sector
is always read from track 18 (regardless of the current track) and the
code in this sector is executed and so in the end controls what
happens.

So far, this is only used for disk flip, but it could also be used
for custom drivecode upload or similar purposes. Right now, all known
productions use the same sector for the disk flip command ($05), but
as the sector is indicated by the command's sector flags, it could in
theory be any sector, because the functionality is entirely controlled
by the code in the sector.

In the case of the flip sector, the code waits for a disk to be loaded
into the drive, where the side id at offset $f9 of the init sector
matches the id stored at offset $01 of the flip sector. After the
correct disk has been identified, the code transfers control to this
new disk's init sector which then proceeds with interpreting the data
stream of this new disk as outlined under "Stream Format", above.

A similar process is used for async requests (see below), except that
the sector used on track 18 is fixed ($06 for all known productions)
as it isn't started by an actual command read from disk, but a host
request.

3.x Example
-----------

Example data from a sector with a CR (Still Rising [009], sector
$01/$0a):

  00  4a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
      ^^
  10  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 7e 7f 59 93
                                        ^^
  [...]
  f0  f7 ce fd e2 bf 93 da 66  c5 02 71 b2 02 8a 28 cc
                        ^^ -- -PP--- ---PP--- ---CR---

This is the CR for the disk's second job, embedded in the first job
(which is controlled by the initial command read from $12/$11 on the
disk). The first job read 13 sectors from track $01, so the current
track is still $01. This command reads the remaining sectors.

[$00] $40 -> not "full" & continuation record | sector $0a
[$fd] command $8a $28 $cc -> 1000 1010  0010 1000  1100 1100
                             ^ "new job", sectors 1,3,7,9,13,14,17,18
[$fc] postponed unit, length $02 [$b2 $71]
[$f9] postponed unit, length $02 [$c5 $66]
[$f6] regular unit, length $da ($f5 ... $1c) [$93 $bf ... $7f $7e]
[$1b] (= $f6-$01-$da) next unit length == $00 -> end of unit chain
      (bytes at $01 ... $1a are not used)

The next command is embedded in sector 17, which looks like this:

  00  51 00 39 90 9e 34 76 b2  19 96 c6 a0 0f e6 d1 dc
      ^^ ^^
  [...]
  f0  05 34 76 bb 15 98 c6 2a  05 f7 2f 6e 02 5f ff ff
                                  ^^ ---PP--- ---CR---

[$00] $40 -> not "full" & continuation record | sector $11
[$fd] command $5f $ff $ff -> 0101 1111  1111 1111  1111 1111
                              ^ "next track", all sector flags set
[$fc] postponed unit, length $02 [$6e $2f]
[$f9] regular unit, length $f7 ($f8 ... $02) [$05 $2a ... $90 $39]
[$01] (= $f9-$01-$f7) next unit length == $00 -> end of unit chain

This command comes into effect when all sectors plus the two postponed
units from sector $01/$0a have been processed and instructs the loader
to step to the next track (in this case track $02) and then read and
process all sectors on that track. The next CR is then found in sector
$02/$05, and so on. (The job spans multiple tracks, including all of
track $05. Its final CR, which contains the first command for the next
job, is then found in sector $05/$08).

Communication Protocols
=======================

As the control flow is embedded in the on-disk data, there is no real
request handling like with other loaders. The drive just keeps sending
the bundles/jobs in the pre-encoded order whenever the host signals
it's ready for more data. The only exception are the "async requests"
of the 3.x revisions (see below).

2.x revisions
-------------

Between block transfers, the 2.x revisions set CLK and DATA to
indicate both the state between bundles ("eof1") and when the drive is
ready to transfer the next bundle (called "eof2" after an "eof1"). The
actual lines used differ between loader revisions:

       |  eof1 | ready |
       |       | /eof2 |
-------|-------|-------|
   2.1 |   CLK |  DATA |
>= 2.2 |  DATA |  CLK  |

In the >= 2.2 revisions the host acknowledges eof1 by setting ATN and
releases it again as acknowledgement for eof2.

The 2.1 revision doesn't acknowledge eof1 but only eof2 by setting ATN
for 21us.

Either way, before the start of the transfer ATN is in the released
state, the "ready" line is set by the drive and the "eof1" line is
(still) set if this is the first transfer of a new bundle, otherwise
it is released, too.

The host then sets ATN and releases it again. The positive edge is the
start signal.

Both the payload data and the checksum are transferred using the 2-bit
transfer protocol. The transfer always includes all 256 bytes of the
current sector, even if it contains a command.

After the checksum has been sent, the drive waits for the host to
release ATN (the clock line).

If the host detected a checksum mismatch, it sets CLK and DATA for
18us when releasing ATN. In this case, the drive will not immediately
resend the same sector, but just not remove it from its list of
requested sectors and transfer it again later.

After the acknowledge check, the drive will set the eof1 line, if this
was the last block of the bundle. It will then fetch either the next
block of the current bundle or the first block of the next bundle
(except if the end of the current disk was reached in which case the
next command requests either a new disk or a drive reset).

3.x revisions
-------------

Data is sent in variable length units. The maximum unit length is 255
bytes in case of a "full" sector (see the 3.x section of "Stream
Format", above).

In the idle state, the host has ATN set, the drive keeps DATA set
("busy") and CLK released.

When the drive is ready to send the next unit, it releases DATA. (When
sending postponed units, it first waits for the host to set CLK).

Data is transferred using the 2-bit send protocol. The protocol is
similar to the 2.x revisions, but 1. no checksum is present and 2. as
the units have variable length, each unit is preceded by a byte
indicating its length.

When the host does not set DATA when it releases ATN for the first
bitpair of the first byte, this signals an "async request". In this
case the transfer is aborted, the drive reads the "async sector" and
transfers control to the code in that sector (see "Async Requests",
below).

Otherwise, after the transfer of a unit is complete (immediately after
the host acknowledged the last bitpair by releasing ATN), the host
sets CLK and DATA to signal status:

- CLK ("chain") is set if either the unit was a postponed unit of
  length 2, or the host released CLK when it released ATN at the start
  of the transfer.
- DATA ("more") is set unless this was the last unit of the job, i.e.
  all (both regular and postponed) units have been transferred. (If
  the CR sector didn't include any postponed units, a 3-byte dummy
  unit is sent instead).

The host acknowledges the status by setting ATN. After that, the drive
sets DATA ("busy") again, releases CLK and either immediately sends
the next unit (if there are multiple regular units in the current
sector or while sending postponed units) otherwise it continues
processing either the current command or the next command, if there
are no more sectors left for the current command.

Async Requests
--------------

If the host doesn't set DATA when releasing ATN in the handshake at
the start of a unit transfer, this signals an async command request.
The drive aborts the transfer of the unit it was about to send, reads
the "async sector" ($12/$06) and executes the code in this sector.

The code reads a 7-bit job index from the host using the 1-bit receive
protocol, which is then used as an index into a table with (half-)
tracks and sectors also stored in the async sector. (The table does
not necessarily contain entries for all jobs on the disk, so the index
into the table might not match the job's index in the order as found
on the disk).

The table is located at offsets $01 to $40 (sectors) and $41 to $80
(half-tracks) in the async sector. The entries are stored in reverse
order, so the entry for index $00 is found at offsets $80 and $40,
respectively.

Note that the sector referenced by the table entry isn't the first
sector of the requested job, but the CR sector with the job's first
command. (In the special case of the disk's first job, the referenced
sector would be the init sector, because that's the sector where the
first job's command is found).

Any units in this sector (both regular and postponed) are ignored
(because they belong to the previous job). Instead, a dummy unit is
sent and the new command found in the CR is then processed as normal.

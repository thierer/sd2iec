Loader Revisions
================

Various revisions have been publicly released, but only revisions
1.0 and >= 1.5 seem to be actually used by any production.

1.0 is only used by OMG Got Balls! [047] and that doesn't even seem to
really use the code released as 1.0, but some pre-release version.

1.0     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=183006
1.1     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=184245
1.2     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=185310
1.3     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=188991
1.4     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=190660
1.5     https://csdb.dk/release/?id=195711

The 1.x revisions only load and transfer a number of predefined files
(called "bundles") in fixed order. All 256 bytes of a sector are used
for payload, no link bytes, like in the standard CBM format, are used.
Instead, the transfer always starts with sector $01/$00 and the next
sectors are calculated using a fixed algorithm (see "Sector Chains",
below).

Starting with 2.0, random access for up to 128 bundles is possible,
using a custom directory which lists the start sector of each bundle.
These revisions also support a basic save functionality (only one file
and limited to one track including the save plugin code, which uses 2
sectors).

Byte-Transfer Protocols
=======================

1-Bit Receive Protocol
----------------------

Used to transfer the bundle number for random loads and the payload
for the 2.x revision's highscore saver.

CLK is used as the clock line and ATN is the data line.

Bytes are sent MSB-first with the bit values inverted (data line low
is bit == 1 and vice versa).

The byte transfer starts at a positive CLK edge.

2-Bit Send Protocol
-------------------

Used for the payload during bundle transfer. This protocol is
identical for all loader revisions.

ATN is used as the clock line and CLK & DATA are the data lines. The
transfer starts on a negative clock edge and ends on a positive edge.

  c0/d0  |  c1/d1  |  c2/d2  |  c3/d3
---------|---------|---------|---------
  b0/b1  |  b2/b3  |  b4/b5  |  b6/b7

Installation
============

None of the loader versions transfer any code using M-W commands, but
instead all drivecode is read directly from sectors on track 18 by
some bootstrap code, which is sent as additional payload in a M-E
command:

    | 0x300 | 0x400 | 0x500 | 0x600 | 0x700
----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
1.x |  $02  |  $06  |  $0a  |  $0e  |  $12
2.x |  $0b  |  $0c  |  $0d  |  $10* |  $0f

*) sector data is encoded (see "Byte Encoding & Sector Layout",
   below).

Disk Layout
===========

The Loader doesn't use the CBM DOS directory or the standard sector
format with the 2 first bytes linking to the next sector at all, but
in general just sends a predefined list of sectors, starting at sector
$01/$00.

Bundle data is stored contiguous, so one sector might hold data for
more than one bundle. The number of sectors in the next bundle is
stored either at offset $01 (most loader revisions) or offset $ff
(only 1.0) of this boundary sector (sector $00 for the first bundle).

The 2.x revisions support random requests using up to 2 directory
sectors ($11 & $12) on track 18, with 4 bytes per entry, for a
maximum of 128 entries (as the sector walk algorithm doesn't care
about files, there could be more files, but then only the 128 included
in the directory could be randomly accessed). Each directory entry
points to the boundary sector of the file (see "Random Access",
below).

Byte Encoding & Sector Layout
-----------------------------

The 2.x revisions prepare the data for transfer during GCR-decoding.
Bits are shuffled/inverted and bytes are stored in reverse order (byte
$00 at offset $00, byte $01 at offset $ff ... byte $ff at offset $01).

These transformations are automatically undone during transfer to the
host, but this also affects data read from the disk which isn't
transferred, but only used in the drive itself, namely:

 - the parameters in the BAM sector (see "Loader Parameters", below),
 - the directory sectors (see "Random Access", below),
 - sector $12/$11, which contains part of the drivecode,
 - the drivecode for the highscore saver, if present.

That's why this data is stored on the disk pre-encoded, so it will be
automatically decoded during GCR-processing.

As the sd2iec firmware reads the plain, encoded data from the disk
images, the parameter values and the directory sectors have to be
decoded before use.

The byte encoding and sector layout differs between loader revisions
(MSB left):

    | encoding | eor | sector layout
----|----------|-----|---------------
1.x | 76543210 | $00 | plain
2.0 | 46570213 | $ff | reversed
2.1 | 76540213 | $7f | reversed

As a special case, the 2.1 pre-release revision used by Padawan's
Awakening [038] uses the 2.1 byte encoding, but an eor value of $ff.

Sector Chains
-------------

Data is read starting at sector $01/$00, then the next sectors in the
chain are calculated using the following recipe:

  if unused_sectors_on_current_track > 0:
    next_sector = current_sector + interleave_for_current_track

    if next_sector >= number_of_sectors_on_current_track: // overflow
      next_sector = next_sector - number_of_sectors_on_current_track

      if track < 18 and next_sector > 0:
        next_sector = next_sector - 1

    while next_sector was already used:
      next_sector = next_sector + 1
      // potential overflow handled as above

  else: // no more unused sectors; advance track
    track = track + 1
    if track == 18:
      track = track + 1             // skip directory track
      next_sector = next_sector + 2 // and add extra interleave

    // special config options only used in very few loader revisions
    if sector_0_on_track_change:
      next_sector = 0
    else if sector_skew:
      next_sector = next_sector - skew_offset
      if track == 19:
        next_sector = next_sector - 8
      if next_sector < 0:
        next_sector = next_sector + number_of_sectors_on_current_track

- Sector skew is only used in Median [032]/[035] (both with an offset
  value of 2).
- The sector is set to 0 after every track change only in Padawan's
  Awakening [038].

Loader Parameters
-----------------

Various loader parameters are stored at the end of the BAM sector
$12/$00 at offsets >= $f1. The exact position and which parameters
are actually present depend on the loader revision:

       f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 fa fb fc fd fe ff
  1.x                          I0    I1 I2    NX BC ID
  2.0     P2 P1 P0 SV             I0    I1 I2 I3 NX ID
  2.1                    P2 P1 P0 SV I0 NX I1 I2 I3 ID

  ID  current disk id
  NX  next disk id
  BC  number of bundles on this disk (only 1.x)
  SV  flag for highscore saver; if == 2 saver present on this disk
  Ix  interleave for the 4 speedzones (I0 1-17 ... I3 >= 31)
  Px  production id bytes 0-2

The interleave is stored as the negative (2s-complement) value. Only
revisions >= 1.3 actually have configurable interleave values, earlier
versions use a fixed interleave of [4 3 3 3].

Note that the parameter values of the 2.x revisions are stored on disk
pre-encoded (see "Byte Encoding & Sector Layout", above).

Random Access
-------------

Only the 2.x revisions have a directory and therefore can randomly
access bundles. The 1.x versions all just load in a fixed sequence
starting from sector $01/$00 until all bundles (as indicated by the
"bundle count" parameter; see "Loader Parameters", above) have been
sent.

The directory is located in sector $11 and $12 on track 18. Each entry
is 4 bytes, for a maximum of 128 entries:

  $00 Track
  $01 Sector          first used sector on track
  $02 Sector Counter  remaining sectors on track
  $03 Buffer Pointer  sent to the host for random access bundles

Note that the entry's "sector" value isn't necessarily the first
sector of the bundle! If the "sector counter" is less than the number
of sectors on the track, the difference is the number of sectors on
the track which have already been used, so the real first sector of
the bundle has to be calculated by iterating that number of sectors
starting from the sector in the directory entry.

For example, on the first disk of E2IRA [025] the directory entry for
the second bundle is [$04 $01 $0e $3a]. So the bundle starts on track
$04, the first sector used on that track after the track change from
track $03 was $01 and as track $04 has $15 sectors, $15-$0e = $07
sectors were already used (exclusively) for data of the first bundle
(the first sector of the new bundle usually also includes the last
bytes of the previous bundle).

E2IRA uses an interleave of 4 sectors for tracks 1-17, so performing
the sector iteration as outlined above for 7 sectors, we find that
sectors $01, $01+$04= $05, $05+$04= $09, $09+$04= $0d, $0d+$04= $11,
$11+$04= $15-$15 (overflow) = $00, $00+$04= $04 were already used and
so the first sector with data of the second bundle is $04+$04= $08.

Request Handling
================

1.0
---

The Host sets ATN when it's ready to receive, the drive sets CLK and
ATNA (releasing DATA) when it's ready to send. Data is transferred
using the 2-bit send protocol, starting at the positive ATN (clock)
edge.

Other 1.x
---------

ATN is always set between transfers. The host releases CLK when it's
ready to receive, the drive sets DATA while busy and sets CLK when
ready to send.

2.x
---

ATN is always set between transfers. While busy, the host also sets
CLK and DATA, while the drive has ATNA set and both CLK and DATA
released.

When the host is ready to make the next request, it keeps ATN set and
either

- releases both CLK and DATA for a sequential load (DATA is released
  because the drive has ATNA set) or
- only releases DATA and keeps CLK set for a random access request.

In case of a random request, the host sends one byte using the 1-bit
receive protocol. A value <= $7f indicates a request for the
respective bundle, $ff a drive reset and any other value a disk change
(see below) to the disk with the id matching the "next id" parameter
of the current disk (see "Loader Parameters", above).

Bundles $7e and $7f are special if the disk has the "saver" parameter
flag set: $7f is the save file itself, which is just addressed as a
regular bundle, so it doesn't need special handling. $7e is the bundle
with the saver code, which will trigger the save mode on the drive
after its first block has been transferred (see "Highscore Saver",
below).

Note that some 2.0 pre-release loader revisions (know productions
using them are Memento Mori [045] and all known reMETA releases) send
the bundle/command byte inverted.

File Transfer
-------------

When the drive is ready to send, it sets CLK and clears ATNA (which
will set DATA, as ATN is still set). The transfer then uses the 2-bit
send protocol starting at the next positive ATN edge, like all other
revisions.

2.x loader revisions modify the data of each bundle's first block
before it is transferred:

- The byte at offset $01 (bundle length) is set to $00.
- For randomly accessed bundles only, the byte at offset $00 is set to
  0 and the byte at offset $ff is set to the "buffer pointer" value of
  the requested bundle's directory entry (see "Random Access", above).

Disk Change
-----------

When the 1.x revisions transferred all bundles as indicated by the
"bundle count" parameter value (see "Loader Parameters", above) it
initiates a disk change waiting for the "next id" if it is not zero.

In the 2.x revisions there are two ways to initiate the disk change
handling:

- Bundle length of the current bundle is 0. This either triggers a
  disk change to the disk with the "next id" or a drive reset, if bit
  7 of "next id" is set (equivalent to "next id" zero for 1.x).
- A request for a bundle with bit 7 set triggers a disk change to disk
  id calculated by clearing bit 7 of the received bundle number
  (exception is bundle number $ff, which also triggers a drive reset).

Highscore Saver
---------------

If the "saver" parameter flag (see "Loader Parameter", above) of the
current disk indicates that the highscore saver is present, the bundle
numbers $7e and $7f refer to the saver code and save file data
bundles, respectively.

The highscore saver can only handle one file and it has to fit on the
last used track together with the saver code bundle, which consists
of two blocks: The first block is the host code, the second block is
the drive code.

The data file can be accessed like any other bundle. A request for
the code bundle is special, only the host code from first block is
sent to the host, the drive code is only read into the sector buffer
and the saver mode then activated by executing the code from there.

This mode uses a similar request loop like for bundle requests, except
that the byte sent is just a flag which indicates if a data block
follows (!= 0) or a zero as the end marker, after all data was
transferred.

The payload for each block is transferred using the 1-bit receive
protocol and written to the sectors found using the standard iteration
algorithm (see "Sector Chains", above).
